# Problem 1
What is the probability that the yellow M&M came from the 1994 bag?

This question amounts to finding out:
$$P(M\&M from \ 1994 \ Bag \cap M\&M \ is \ Yellow)$$ 

Because the events are independent, this is equivalent to 
$$P(M\&M from \ 1994 \ Bag) \times P(M\&M \ is \ Yellow) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{20}{100} = 10 \%$$
